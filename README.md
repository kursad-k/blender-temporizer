
This add-on lets you easily make temporary snapshots of you currently open file in a predefined folder, so that you can make as many file versions as you want without worrying about saving over your originals or polluting your project folders with many versions of the same file. 

It is great for making tests and  trials with your opened file, it is also great when you want to version your files frequently but you do not want to save them in your project folders.

You might want to define a cache folder in the settings. Otherwise the add-on just saves to system's temporary folder.
